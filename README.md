# Mobile Analysis Project

This repository contains a mobile analysis project that utilizes SQL and Power BI to analyze and compare various mobile phones based on different features such as phone name, brand, internal storage, camera quality, operating system, USB type, 5G availability, RAM, country of origin, battery capacity, and prices.

The project aims to assist individuals in making informed decisions when purchasing a new phone by providing a comprehensive comparison of different features that they desire.

## **Data**
The data for this project is stored in a SQL database and consists of a table with the following columns:

**Phone Name**: The name or model of the mobile phone.

**Brand**: The brand or manufacturer of the phone.

**Internal Storage**: The storage capacity of the phone's internal memory.

**Camera Quality**: The quality of the phone's camera, typically represented in megapixels.

**Operating System**: The operating system running on the phone.

**USB Type**: The type of USB connector supported by the phone.

**5G Availability**: Indicates whether the phone supports 5G connectivity.

**RAM**: The amount of random-access memory (RAM) available on the phone.

**Country of Origin**: The country where the phone is manufactured.

**Battery Capacity**: The capacity of the phone's battery, usually measured in milliampere-hours (mAh).

**Price**: The price of the phone in a specific currency.

## **Analysis and Comparison**
This project provides users with the ability to compare different mobile phones based on their desired features. By leveraging SQL queries and Power BI visualizations, the project enables users to make data-driven decisions when purchasing a new phone.

The following steps outline how the project can help individuals in their decision-making process:

**Filtering**: Users can filter the mobile phones based on specific criteria such as brand, operating system, camera quality, 5G availability, and more. This allows them to narrow down their options to phones that meet their requirements.

**Sorting**: Users can sort the phones based on different attributes such as price, internal storage, camera quality, and battery capacity. This helps users identify phones that offer the best value for their desired features.

**Visualizations**: The project provides interactive visualizations using Power BI, allowing users to gain insights and compare different phones visually. They can explore charts and graphs representing features like camera quality versus price, RAM versus battery capacity, or any other combination of attributes.

**Price Range Analysis**: Users can set a specific budget and analyze phones within that price range. They can see the phones that fall within their budget and compare their features to make an informed decision.

**Country of Origin**: Some users may have preferences for phones manufactured in specific countries. The project allows users to filter and compare phones based on their country of origin, giving them the ability to support local manufacturing or choose phones from certain regions.

**Future-proofing**: With the inclusion of 5G availability, users can assess whether a phone supports the latest generation of cellular technology. This helps individuals who desire faster internet speeds and want to ensure their phone is compatible with future network advancements.

By leveraging the power of SQL and Power BI, this project empowers users to make objective comparisons and select the mobile phone that best fits their preferences, budget, and desired features.
